## The Odin Project - Calculator

Second Javascript project 

Make a basic on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It should not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at the same time.

## Languages/Technologies used:
 - HTML/CSS/Javascript
 - VS Code
 - Git/Github
 - Chrome developer tools
 - Flexbox
 - CSS Grid
 
## What I learned:
 - Used CSS Grid for the first time to display calculator
 - Better understanding of javascript, and refactoring code as I add more complex functions and fix bugs
 
## Still can improve:
 - Clean up code, multiple if statements that I'm using seem messy
 - Add keyboard support
 - Mobile support and browser compatibility
